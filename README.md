## Note
The SurfaceRT is an old device, and work is still being done to fully support the Tegra3 SOC. 
Running Linux will not make this device any faster, and will probably only serve to make it slower.  
  
If you or a friend are very knowledgeble with Linux and want to help contribute to writing drivers 
for the Tegra3 SOC and the SurfaceRT, get in kahoots with the [grate-driver](https://github.com/grate-driver)
and the [OpenRT](https://discord.gg/tAxvvVC) teams.
